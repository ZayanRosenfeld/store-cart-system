The Check and Cart systems of my fictional store called Zayrango

it runs through standard command in the terminal:
java zayrango.Check

Functionality:
- Cart with 3 products
- Calculator of products bought, price all together, each line of data for each product
- Showing of items in stock

Tools used are simple for Java:
- Arraylist to create list of product (Was a difficult one to take in)
- Scanner to take info from user
